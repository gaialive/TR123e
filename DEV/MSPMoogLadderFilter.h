 * @brief Moog Ladder Filter based on Antti Huovilainen's improved nonlinear model
 * 
 * This implementation represents a direct translation from Max/MSP Gen~ code to C++,
 * specifically derived from the TR123 project's moogLadderFilter Gen~ patch. It implements
 * Antti Huovilainen's enhanced model that addresses limitations in earlier digital
 * implementations through improved nonlinear modeling and thermal noise simulation.
 * 
 * @historical_context_and_research_lineage
 * This filter represents a significant advancement in digital analog modeling research:
 * 
 * **Original Research (2004)**: Antti Huovilainen's seminal paper "Non-linear digital 
 * implementation of the moog ladder filter" identified key limitations in existing 
 * digital models:
 * - Insufficient nonlinear behavior modeling
 * - Missing thermal noise characteristics 
 * - Frequency response inaccuracies at high resonance
 * - Lack of proper saturation modeling
 * 
 * **Max/MSP Implementation**: The original Gen~ code provided a real-time implementation
 * suitable for musical performance and production applications.
 * 
 * **C++ Translation**: This implementation maintains the exact algorithm while providing
 * optimized C++ code structure for integration into native audio applications.
 * 
 * @huovilainen_model_innovations
 * Huovilainen's model introduced several critical improvements over earlier approaches:
 * 
 * 1. **Dual-Iteration Processing**: Two-pass algorithm for improved numerical accuracy
 * 2. **Nonlinear Saturation Modeling**: Multiple saturation stages with different characteristics
 * 3. **Thermal Noise Injection**: Simulates Johnson noise in analog circuits
 * 4. **Frequency-Dependent Resonance**: Models the frequency-dependent Q behavior
 * 5. **Multiple Filter Modes**: Six different response types from single topology
 * 6. **Improved Frequency Warping**: Enhanced compensation for digital sampling effects
 * 
 * @mathematical_foundation
 * The implementation is based on the discrete-time state-space model:
 * 
 * x[n+1] = A·x[n] + B·u[n] + f(x[n], u[n])
 * y[n] = C·x[n] + D·u[n]
 * 
 * Where:
 * - x[n] = [stage1State, stage2State, stage3State, stage4State]ᵀ
 * - u[n] = inputSignal (with thermal noise)
 * - f(x[n], u[n]) = nonlinear correction terms
 * - A, B, C, D = matrices dependent on cutoff frequency and resonance
 * 
 * @nonlinear_modeling_theory
 * The nonlinear behavior is modeled through multiple mechanisms:
 * 
 * **Saturation Function**: s(x) = x·(1 - ⅓x²) for |x| ≤ 1
 * **Feedback Saturation**: tanh-like behavior in resonance feedback path
 * **Thermal Noise**: Gaussian noise injection at ~1×10⁻¹¹ amplitude
 * **Frequency-Dependent Nonlinearity**: Saturation characteristics vary with frequency
 * 
 * @gen_to_cpp_translation_methodology
 * The translation from Max/MSP Gen~ to C++ involved several considerations:
 * 
 * **Data Type Conversion**: Gen~ uses 64-bit floating-point; maintained in C++
 * **State Management**: Gen~ automatic state persistence mapped to class members
 * **Parameter Mapping**: Gen~ inlet/outlet structure converted to function parameters
 * **Optimization Preservation**: Maintained Gen~'s computational efficiency optimizations
 * **Real-time Safety**: Preserved Gen~'s real-time processing guarantees
 * 
 * @performance_characteristics
 * - Computational complexity: O(1) per sample (fixed operations regardless of parameters)
 * - Memory footprint: 120 bytes (15 double-precision state variables)
 * - Processing overhead: ~80-100 floating-point operations per sample
 * - Numerical stability: Denormal protection and bounded nonlinear functions
 * - Dynamic range: >140dB with proper gain staging
 * 
 * @filter_modes_specifications
 * Six distinct filter responses derived from ladder topology:
 * 
 * 1. **LP24**: 24dB/octave lowpass (classic Moog response)
 * 2. **HP24**: 24dB/octave highpass (input - lowpass)
 * 3. **BP24**: 24dB/octave bandpass (complex stage combinations)
 * 4. **LP18**: 18dB/octave lowpass (3-pole response)
 * 5. **BP18**: 18dB/octave bandpass (modified stage combinations)
 * 6. **HP6**: 6dB/octave highpass (single-pole derivative)
