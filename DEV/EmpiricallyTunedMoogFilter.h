 * @brief Empirically-tuned Virtual Analog Moog filter with performance optimization
 * 
 * This implementation represents a practical approach to Moog ladder filter modeling
 * that emphasizes computational efficiency and real-world performance over theoretical
 * precision. The empirical tuning approach uses carefully chosen coefficients derived
 * from extensive listening tests and measurement comparisons with analog hardware.
 * 
 * @empirical_tuning_methodology
 * Unlike implementations based purely on circuit analysis, this filter uses coefficients
 * determined through:
 * - **Listening Tests**: Subjective evaluation against analog Moog hardware
 * - **Frequency Response Matching**: Objective measurement of magnitude/phase response
 * - **Transient Analysis**: Evaluation of attack/decay characteristics
 * - **Nonlinear Behavior Modeling**: Saturation and feedback characteristics
 * - **Performance Optimization**: Coefficient selection for computational efficiency
 * 
 * @virtual_analog_philosophy
 * The Virtual Analog (VA) approach prioritizes:
 * - **Musical Accuracy**: Sound quality over mathematical precision
 * - **Real-time Performance**: Optimized for live performance applications
 * - **Hardware Compatibility**: Efficient on typical audio processing hardware
 * - **Parameter Stability**: Smooth behavior across control ranges
 * - **Practical Implementation**: Straightforward integration into audio systems
 * 
 * @performance_optimization_techniques
 * - **Fast Tanh Approximation**: Rational function approximation for nonlinearity
 * - **Coefficient Caching**: Pre-computation of parameter-dependent values
 * - **Simplified Topology**: Streamlined algorithm without unnecessary complexity
 * - **Block Processing**: Optimized batch processing for audio buffers
 * - **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal state variables and cache-friendly layout

/**
 * @class MoogFilter
 * @brief Empirically-tuned Virtual Analog Moog ladder filter implementation
 * 
 * This class provides a complete Moog ladder filter implementation optimized for
 * real-world audio processing applications. The design emphasizes computational
 * efficiency, musical accuracy, and practical usability over theoretical precision,
 * making it ideal for live performance and production environments.
 * 
 * @design_characteristics
 * - **Empirical Coefficient Selection**: Parameters chosen through extensive testing
 * - **Performance Optimization**: Fast approximations where appropriate
 * - **Musical Responsiveness**: Smooth parameter control without artifacts
 * - **Practical Range Limits**: Sensible parameter bounds for musical use
 * - **Block Processing Support**: Efficient batch processing capabilities
 * 
 * @coefficient_derivation
 * The filter coefficients are derived from empirical analysis rather than
 * direct circuit modeling:
 * - **f = fc × 1.16**: Frequency scaling for musical response
 * - **k = 4 × resonance × (1 - 0.15 × f²)**: Frequency-dependent resonance
 * - **p = f × (1.8 - 0.8 × f)**: Pole frequency adjustment
 * - **scale = 1 - p**: Complementary scaling factor
 * 
 * @applications
 * - Live performance synthesizers requiring low latency
 * - Digital audio workstations (DAWs) needing efficient processing
 * - Hardware audio processors with limited computational resources
 * - Real-time audio effects requiring smooth parameter control
 * - Educational applications demonstrating VA modeling techniques
