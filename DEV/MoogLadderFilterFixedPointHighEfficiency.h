/**
 * @file MoogLadderFilterFixedPoint.h
 * @brief High-efficiency fixed-point Moog ladder filter for embedded systems
 * 
 * This header defines a specialized fixed-point implementation of the Moog ladder
 * filter designed for embedded systems, microcontrollers, and applications where
 * floating-point processing is unavailable, too expensive, or where deterministic
 * bit-exact results are required across different platforms and runs.
 * 
 * @fixed_point_advantages
 * Fixed-point arithmetic provides several critical benefits for embedded audio:
 * 
 * **Deterministic Performance**: Execution time is completely predictable without
 * floating-point unit dependencies, making it ideal for hard real-time systems
 * where timing guarantees are essential.
 * 
 * **Resource Efficiency**: Significantly reduced memory bandwidth and power
 * consumption compared to floating-point operations, crucial for battery-powered
 * and resource-constrained devices.
 * 
 * **Platform Independence**: Bit-exact results across different processor
 * architectures, compilers, and floating-point implementations, ensuring
 * consistent behavior for audio applications requiring reproducibility.
 * 
 * **Hardware Compatibility**: Functions on microcontrollers and processors
 * without dedicated floating-point units, expanding deployment possibilities
 * to low-cost embedded platforms.
 * 
 * @fixed_point_format_specification
 * The implementation uses Q16.16 fixed-point format throughout:
 * 
 * **Format Definition**: 32-bit signed integers with 16 integer and 16 fractional bits
 * **Range**: [-32768.0, +32767.999984741] with resolution ~1.53×10⁻⁵
 * **Precision**: Sufficient for 16-bit audio with careful gain staging
 * **Arithmetic**: Standard integer operations with appropriate bit shifting
 * 
 * @performance_characteristics
 * - **Computational Cost**: ~15-20 integer operations per sample
 * - **Memory Footprint**: 32 bytes (8 × 4-byte integers)
 * - **Execution Time**: Completely deterministic and predictable
 * - **Power Consumption**: Significantly lower than floating-point equivalent
 * - **Cache Behavior**: Optimal due to smaller data sizes and alignment
 * 
 * @target_platforms
 * - ARM Cortex-M series microcontrollers (M0, M3, M4 without FPU)
 * - Arduino and compatible embedded development platforms
 * - Raspberry Pi Pico and similar resource-constrained systems
 * - Custom DSP hardware without floating-point capabilities
 * - Legacy systems requiring deterministic audio processing
 * 
 * @applications
 * - Embedded synthesizers and drum machines
 * - IoT audio devices with power constraints
 * - Real-time audio effects for microcontroller platforms
 * - Educational projects demonstrating fixed-point DSP
 * - Industrial audio systems requiring deterministic behavior
