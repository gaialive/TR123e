 * @file MoogLadderFilter.h
 * @brief Simplified bilinear transform Moog ladder filter with educational clarity
 * 
 * This header defines a streamlined implementation of the Moog ladder filter that
 * emphasizes educational clarity and implementation simplicity while maintaining
 * the essential characteristics of the classic analog sound. The design prioritizes
 * understanding and accessibility over complex optimization, making it ideal for
 * educational applications and as a foundation for more advanced implementations.
 * 
 * @educational_philosophy
 * This implementation follows several key educational principles:
 * 
 * **Conceptual Clarity**: Each component and calculation has a clear purpose that
 * directly relates to analog filter theory, making the relationship between digital
 * implementation and analog behavior transparent and understandable.
 * 
 * **Implementation Simplicity**: The code structure prioritizes readability and
 * comprehension over optimization, allowing students and researchers to easily
 * understand the fundamental principles of digital analog modeling.
 * 
 * **Mathematical Accessibility**: Uses straightforward mathematical operations
 * without complex approximations or optimizations that might obscure the
 * underlying theoretical foundations.
 * 
 * @theoretical_foundation
 * The implementation is based on the bilinear transform approach to digital filter design:
 * 
 * **Bilinear Transform Theory**: s ↔ (2/T) × (z-1)/(z+1)
 * - Provides stable mapping from s-plane to z-plane
 * - Maintains filter stability characteristics
 * - Enables direct analog-to-digital filter conversion
 * - Requires frequency pre-warping for accurate frequency response
 * 
 * **Four-Pole Ladder Topology**: Four cascaded one-pole lowpass sections
 * - Each pole contributes 6dB/octave attenuation
 * - Combined response: 24dB/octave lowpass characteristic
 * - Resonance feedback from output to input creates characteristic peak
 * - Nonlinear saturation (tanh) at each stage provides analog warmth
 * 
 * @implementation_characteristics
 * - **Processing Model**: Sample-by-sample with straightforward state management
 * - **Computational Cost**: ~20-25 floating-point operations per sample
 * - **Memory Footprint**: ~60 bytes (15 float members)
 * - **Numerical Stability**: Stable across all parameter ranges with proper coefficient design
 * - **Educational Value**: Clear correspondence between code and analog filter theory
 * 
 * @applications
 * - Educational demonstrations of digital filter theory
 * - Foundation for understanding more complex implementations
 * - Basic synthesis applications requiring simple, reliable filtering
 * - Algorithm development and prototyping platform
 * - Reference implementation for correctness validation
