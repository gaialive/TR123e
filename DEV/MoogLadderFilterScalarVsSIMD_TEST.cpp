RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: Controlled Experimental Design for Performance Evaluation
TESTING FRAMEWORK: Impulse Response Analysis and Real-time Verification

ABSTRACT:
This implementation provides a rigorous testing framework for comparing scalar
and SIMD implementations of Moog ladder filters. The methodology employs impulse

performance measurement. This approach represents best practices in digital
signal processing algorithm verification and optimization analysis.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND:
Impulse response testing is fundamental to linear systems analysis, providing
complete characterization of filter behavior. By applying identical impulse
inputs to both implementations, any differences in output indicate algorithmic
discrepancies or numerical precision variations. This methodology enables
rigorous scientific comparison of optimization techniques.

RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS:
1. Demonstrates scientific methodology for audio algorithm verification
2. Provides framework for quantitative performance analysis
3. Shows proper experimental design for comparative studies
4. Implements real-time verification techniques
5. Establishes baseline for optimization effectiveness measurement

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Controlled input conditions (impulse response)
- Simultaneous processing for timing accuracy
- Quantitative output comparison
- Real-time performance measurement
- Systematic data collection and logging

ACADEMIC SIGNIFICANCE:
This testing framework serves as a model for rigorous evaluation of audio
processing optimizations, ensuring both correctness and performance benefits
are properly validated through scientific methodology.

ACADEMIC PURPOSE:
Instantiates both scalar and SIMD filter implementations with identical
configurations for direct comparison. This approach ensures that any
performance or output differences derive solely from the implementation
optimization rather than parameter variations.

COMPARATIVE METHODOLOGY:
Both filters initialized with identical sample rates and will receive
identical parameter configurations to ensure fair comparison conditions.

ACADEMIC RATIONALE:

characteristics while maintaining manageable data collection. The limited
sample count allows for comprehensive logging and analysis of each sample.

FUNCTION: setup()
================================================================================
ACADEMIC PURPOSE:
Initializes both filter implementations with identical parameters to ensure
fair comparison conditions. This function establishes the controlled
experimental environment necessary for rigorous comparative analysis.

PARAMETER CONFIGURATION:
All parameters set to identical values across implementations:
- Cutoff frequency: 1000 Hz (mid-frequency for clear response)
- Resonance: 0.3 (moderate resonance for stability)
- Shape: 0.5 (balanced filter characteristic)
- Mode: 0 (standard lowpass operation)

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY:
Identical parameter configuration eliminates variable parameters as sources
of difference, isolating optimization effects for accurate measurement.
