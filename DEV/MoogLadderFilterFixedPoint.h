 * @file MoogLadderFilterFixedPoint.h (Inferred)
 * @brief High-performance fixed-point Moog ladder filter for resource-constrained systems
 * 
 * This implementation represents a specialized approach to digital analog modeling using
 * fixed-point arithmetic for applications where floating-point processing is either
 * unavailable, too expensive computationally, or where deterministic bit-exact results
 * are required across platforms. The fixed-point approach trades some precision for
 * significant performance gains and reduced memory bandwidth requirements.
 * 
 * @computational_paradigm_analysis
 * Fixed-point arithmetic offers several advantages for real-time audio processing:
 * 
 * **Performance Benefits:**
 * - Deterministic execution time (no floating-point unit dependencies)
 * - Reduced power consumption (critical for mobile/embedded applications)
 * - Smaller memory footprint (32-bit integers vs 64-bit doubles)
 * - Faster context switching (smaller register state)
 * - Predictable cache behavior (fixed data sizes)
 * 
 * **Precision Considerations:**
 * - Limited dynamic range compared to floating-point
 * - Requires careful scaling to prevent overflow/underflow
 * - Quantization noise becomes significant factor
 * - Coefficient precision directly impacts frequency accuracy
 * 
 * @fixed_point_format_specification
 * This implementation uses Q16.16 fixed-point format where:
 * - 16 bits represent integer portion
 * - 16 bits represent fractional portion  
 * - Range: [-32768.0, 32767.999984741] with resolution of ~1.53×10⁻⁵
 * - Sufficient precision for 16-bit audio with careful gain staging
 * 
 * @research_significance
 * Fixed-point implementations are crucial for:
 * - Embedded audio systems (microcontrollers, DSP chips)
 * - Mobile audio applications (battery life optimization)
 * - Real-time systems requiring deterministic behavior
 * - Legacy hardware support (systems without FPU)
 * - Bit-exact reproducibility across platforms
