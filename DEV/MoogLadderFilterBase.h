 * 
 * **Unified Interface Design**: Common method signatures and parameter conventions across
 * all implementation variants, enabling interchangeable usage and systematic performance
 * comparison without requiring application code modifications.
 * 
 * **Performance-Oriented Utilities**: Shared utility functions optimized for both scalar
 * and vector operations, including specialized denormal protection, parameter clamping,
 * and SIMD-specific mathematical operations.
 * 
 * **Implementation Flexibility**: Support for both ARM NEON vectorized processing and
 * traditional scalar operations within a cohesive framework that maximizes code reuse
 * while enabling implementation-specific optimizations.
 * 
 * **Research Validation Framework**: Consistent interfaces that facilitate systematic
 * algorithm comparison, performance analysis, and validation across different optimization
 * approaches and computational paradigms.
 * 
 * @design_pattern_analysis
 * The architecture implements several established software design patterns:
 * 
 * **Template Method Pattern**: Common interface structure with implementation-specific
 * optimizations, allowing algorithmic variations while maintaining behavioral consistency.
 * 
 * **Strategy Pattern**: Interchangeable scalar and vector implementations that can be
 * selected based on performance requirements and hardware capabilities.
 * 
 * **Facade Pattern**: Simplified interface that abstracts complex internal optimizations
 * and provides clean, intuitive access to advanced filter functionality.
 * 
 * **Utility Pattern**: Shared helper functions that provide common functionality across
 * multiple implementations without code duplication or performance overhead.
 * 
 * @performance_engineering_foundations
 * The base architecture incorporates several performance engineering principles:
 * 
 * **Computational Efficiency**: Inline utility functions eliminate function call overhead
 * while providing compiler optimization opportunities across all implementations.
 * 
 * **Memory Optimization**: Aligned data structures and cache-friendly access patterns
 * optimized for modern processor architectures and memory hierarchies.
 *

/**
 * @brief Denormal number protection for sustained audio processing performance

 * @param val Input floating-point value to be checked and potentially corrected
 * @return 0.0f if input is denormal, otherwise returns original value unchanged
 * 
 * Prevents denormal floating-point numbers that can cause severe CPU performance
 * degradation in recursive digital filters. Denormal numbers occur when floating-point
 * values become extremely small and require special processor handling that can be
 * 100x slower than normal arithmetic operations.
 * 
 * @complexity O(1) - Single comparison and conditional assignment
 * @threshold 1×10⁻³⁰ (well below any musically relevant signal levels)
 * @performance_impact Critical for maintaining real-time performance guarantees
 * 
 * @denormal_number_theory
 * IEEE 754 floating-point representation includes denormal (subnormal) numbers
 * that represent values smaller than the minimum normalized value:
 * 
 * - **Normal Range**: [1.175×10⁻³⁸, 3.403×10³⁸] for 32-bit float
 * - **Denormal Range**: [1.401×10⁻⁴⁵, 1.175×10⁻³⁸] for 32-bit float
 * - **Processing Cost**: 10-100x slower due to software emulation requirements
 * - **Musical Relevance**: Far below noise floor of any practical audio system
 * 
 * @performance_analysis
 * In recursive digital filters, denormal numbers can cause:
 * - Severe CPU performance degradation (10-100x slowdown)
 * - Inconsistent real-time performance characteristics
 * - Audio dropouts in resource-constrained systems
 * - Thermal throttling in mobile and embedded devices
 * - Unpredictable latency in real-time audio applications
 * 
 * @threshold_selection_rationale
 * The 1×10⁻³⁰ threshold is chosen because:
 * - Well below -600dB (completely inaudible in any practical context)
 * - Above IEEE 754 denormal range (catches all denormal conditions)
 * - Preserves all musically relevant signal content
 * - Provides consistent performance across processor architectures
 * - Eliminates precision-related filter instabilities
 * 
 * @usage_patterns
 * Typically applied to filter state variables and feedback signals:
 * - Filter stage outputs before storage in delay lines
 * - Feedback signals in recursive topologies
 * - Envelope generator outputs approaching zero
 * - LFO outputs during fade-in/fade-out periods

 * @brief Efficient vector division using Newton-Raphson approximation

 * @param a Numerator vector (dividend)
 * @param b Denominator vector (divisor)
 * @return Division result vector (a ÷ b)
 * 
 * Implements fast vector division essential for SIMD audio processing applications
 * where standard division operations are either unavailable or prohibitively expensive.
 * Uses ARM NEON reciprocal estimate with Newton-Raphson refinement to achieve
 * acceptable accuracy for audio applications while maintaining vectorized performance.
 * 
 * @complexity O(1) - Fixed number of vector operations regardless of input values
 * @accuracy Approximately 16-24 bit precision after refinement
 * @performance Significantly faster than element-wise scalar division
 * 
 * @algorithm_implementation
 * The implementation uses a two-stage process for optimal accuracy:
 * 
 * **Stage 1: Initial Estimate**
 * ```cpp
 * reciprocal = vrecpeq_f32(b);  // Hardware reciprocal estimate (~8-bit accuracy)
 * ```
 * 
 * **Stage 2: Newton-Raphson Refinement**
 * ```cpp
 * reciprocal = vmulq_f32(vrecpsq_f32(b, reciprocal), reciprocal);  // ~16-bit accuracy
 * ```
 * 
 * **Stage 3: Final Multiplication**
 * ```cpp
 * result = vmulq_f32(a, reciprocal);  // a × (1/b) = a ÷ b
 * ```
 * 
 * @mathematical_foundation
 * Newton-Raphson method for reciprocal calculation:
 * 
 * Given f(x) = 1/x - c, finding root gives x = 1/c
 * Iteration formula: x_{n+1} = x_n × (2 - c × x_n)
 * 
 * Where:
 * - c = denominator value
 * - x_0 = initial hardware estimate
 * - Each iteration approximately doubles precision
 * 
 * @accuracy_analysis
 * - **Initial Estimate**: ~8-bit precision (hardware vrecpeq_f32)
 * - **After 1 Iteration**: ~16-bit precision (sufficient for most audio)
 * - **After 2 Iterations**: ~24-bit precision (approaching float precision)
 * - **Error Characteristics**: Monotonically decreasing with each iteration
 * 
 * @performance_comparison
 * Compared to scalar division in vector context:
 * - **Scalar Approach**: 4 individual division operations
 * - **Vector Approach**: 1 estimate + 1 refinement + 1 multiply
 * - **Speedup**: Typically 2-4x faster depending on processor implementation
 * - **Energy**: Reduced power consumption per operation
 * 
 * @usage_contexts
 * Essential for vectorized implementations of:
 * - Rational function approximations (tanh, sigmoid)
 * - Frequency normalization calculations
 * - Gain and scaling factor applications
 * - Complex mathematical expressions requiring division
 * - Filter coefficient calculations with frequency-dependent terms
 * 
 * @limitations_and_considerations
 * - **Accuracy Trade-off**: Slightly less precise than true division
 * - **Denormal Handling**: May require additional protection for very small denominators
 * - **Special Values**: Undefined behavior for zero denominators (requires pre-validation)
 * - **Range Sensitivity**: Accuracy may vary across different magnitude ranges
