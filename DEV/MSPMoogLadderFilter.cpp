 * This function provides essential protection against denormal floating-point
 * numbers that can cause severe CPU performance degradation in recursive
 * digital filters. The function uses a threshold well below any musically
 * relevant signal levels to identify and eliminate denormal conditions.
 * 
 * @performance_impact
 * Without denormal protection, recursive filters can experience:
 * - 100x or greater CPU performance degradation
 * - Inconsistent real-time performance
 * - Audio dropouts in resource-constrained systems
 * - Thermal throttling in mobile devices
 * 
 * @threshold_selection
 * The 1×10⁻¹⁸ threshold is chosen because:
 * - Well below -360dB (inaudible in any practical system)
 * - High enough to catch IEEE 754 denormal range
 * - Preserves all musically relevant signal content
 * - Provides consistent performance across platforms
