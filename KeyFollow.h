/**

 * @brief Keyboard tracking module for filter frequency modulation
 * 
 * This module implements keyboard tracking (key follow) functionality commonly
 * found in analog synthesizers. It provides proportional filter cutoff frequency
 * adjustment based on the played MIDI note number, ensuring consistent timbre
 * across the keyboard range.
 * 
 * @theory_background
 * In acoustic instruments, higher pitched notes naturally contain more high-frequency
 * content. To maintain consistent perceived brightness across the keyboard, synthesizer
 * filters traditionally open proportionally with higher notes. This module implements
 * this behavior using configurable tracking intensity.
 * 
 * @mathematical_model
 * Output = (max(0, note - 36) * 0.33 + 36) * tracking_amount
 * 
 * Where:
 * - Note 36 (C2) serves as the reference frequency (0 Hz offset)
 * - 0.33 scaling factor provides musically appropriate tracking slope
 * - Linear mapping ensures predictable frequency relationships
 * 
 * @performance_characteristics
 * - Computational complexity: O(1) constant time
 * - Memory footprint: Single float member variable
 * - Real-time safe: No dynamic allocation or blocking operations
 * - Thread safe: Stateless processing with atomic parameter updates

 * @class KeyFollow
 * @brief Implements keyboard tracking for filter frequency modulation
 * 
 * The KeyFollow class provides real-time keyboard tracking functionality,
 * generating frequency offset values based on MIDI note numbers. The implementation
 * uses a linear mapping with configurable intensity to maintain musical
 * relationships while allowing artistic control over tracking behavior.
 * 
 * @design_pattern
 * - Strategy Pattern: Encapsulates keyboard tracking algorithm
 * - Value Object: Immutable processing with configurable parameters
 * - Real-time Safe: No dynamic allocation in processing path
 * 
 * @usage_example
 * @code
 * KeyFollow keyTracker(0.05f);  // 5% tracking intensity
 * float offset = keyTracker.process(60);  // Process middle C (C4)
 * float cutoff = baseCutoff + offset;     // Apply to filter cutoff
 * @endcode
