/**
 * @file PortamentoFilter.h
 * @brief Legato playing technique detection and portamento triggering logic
 * 
 * This module implements sophisticated analysis of MIDI note patterns to determine
 * when portamento (smooth pitch transitions) should be applied in monophonic synthesis.
 * The system distinguishes between legato and staccato playing techniques through
 * temporal analysis of note overlap patterns, providing musically intelligent
 * portamento behavior that responds to performer intent.
 * 
 * @musical_theory_background
 * Portamento is a musical ornament involving a continuous slide between two pitches,
 * commonly used in string, vocal, and synthesizer performance. In traditional acoustic
 * instruments, portamento occurs naturally during legato playing when the performer
 * transitions between notes without releasing the first. Electronic synthesizers
 * must analyze playing technique to determine when this effect should be applied.
 * 
 * @detection_algorithm
 * The system employs a state machine approach to analyze note timing patterns:
 * 
 * 1. **Overlap Detection**: Identifies when new note-on occurs before previous note-off
 * 2. **Pitch Analysis**: Ensures portamento only triggers for different note values
 * 3. **State Tracking**: Maintains previous note information for comparison
 * 
 * This approach provides musically intelligent behavior that matches performer expectations
 * from acoustic instruments and traditional analog synthesizers.
 * 
 * @performance_characteristics
 * - Computational complexity: O(1) for all operations
 * - Memory footprint: 12 bytes (3 member variables)
 * - Real-time safety: No dynamic allocation or blocking operations
 * - Deterministic execution: Bounded processing time for all inputs

/**
 * @class PortamentoFilter
 * @brief Musical technique analyzer for intelligent portamento triggering
 * 
 * The PortamentoFilter class implements real-time analysis of MIDI note patterns
 * to determine when portamento should be applied based on legato playing technique
 * detection. This provides musically intelligent behavior that responds appropriately
 * to different performance styles without requiring explicit control messages.
 * 
 * @design_philosophy
 * The implementation prioritizes musical accuracy over technical complexity,
 * using simple but effective heuristics that match performer expectations
 * from acoustic instruments. The algorithm errs toward conservative portamento
 * triggering to avoid unwanted pitch slides during fast passages.
 * 
 * @state_machine_design
 * ```
 * [IDLE] --note_on--> [NOTE_ACTIVE]
 *   |                       |
 *   |                   note_on(different) --> [PORTAMENTO_TRIGGER]
 *   |                       |
 *   +--note_off<------------+
 * ```
 * 
 * @musical_applications
 * - Lead synthesizer voices requiring expressive pitch slides
 * - Bass lines with smooth frequency transitions
 * - Vocal synthesis emulation with natural portamento
 * - Educational software teaching legato technique
 * 
 * @usage_example
 * @code
 * PortamentoFilter filter;
 * 
 * // In MIDI processing loop:
 * bool usePortamento = filter.checkPortamento(noteNumber, isNoteOn, timestamp);
 * if (usePortamento) {
 *     player.noteOn(noteNumber, true);  // Enable smooth transition
 * } else {
 *     player.noteOn(noteNumber, false); // Immediate frequency jump
 * }

     * 2. Verify new note differs from previous (pitch change requirement)
     * 3. Update internal state with new note information
     * 4. Return portamento decision based on overlap AND pitch change
     * 
     * For note-off events:
     * 1. Mark previous note as inactive
     * 2. Record note-off timestamp for future temporal analysis
     * 3. Return false (portamento not applicable to note-off)
     * 
     * @musical_considerations
     * - Portamento only triggers for overlapping notes with different pitches
     * - Same-note retriggering does not activate portamento (trill protection)
     * - Note-off events update state but never trigger portamento
     * - First note after silence never triggers portamento (no source pitch)
     * 
     * @edge_cases
     * - Rapid note repetition: Prevented by pitch difference requirement
     * - Simultaneous note-on/note-off: Handled by state precedence rules
     * - Invalid MIDI note numbers: Processed without validation for performance
