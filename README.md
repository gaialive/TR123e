# TR-123e

**TR-123e** is a monophonic embedded bass synthesiser inspired by the iconic Moog ladder filter architecture, developed using the Bela real-time audio platform as the final project of the undergraduate degree BMus/BSc Electronic Music with Computing & Technology, at Goldsmiths, University of London. This repository contains the complete C++ source code.

## Overview

TR-123e translates a sophisticated Max/MSP gen\~ patch into a modular embedded synthesiser using Bela. It features:

* **Zero Delay Feedback (ZDF)** four-pole Moog ladder filter
* Real-time MIDI input processing with portamento
* Dynamic ADSR envelope modulation
* An expressive eight-parameter hardware interface
* Audiovisual integration with TouchDesigner

## Project Motivation

This project addresses the challenge of maintaining the sonic expressiveness and responsiveness of software-based synthesis when translated into hardware. By implementing efficient DSP techniques and integrating performance-focused controls, TR-123e delivers a highly responsive, expressive instrument suitable for live electronic music performance and audiovisual installations.

## Key Technical Features

* **Real-Time DSP Optimization**: Achieves stable, low-latency (\~1ms) performance on ARM architecture.
* **Modular C++ Architecture**: Clearly structured, modular classes for easy modification and expansion.
* **Comparative Filter Implementation**: Includes systematic comparisons of filter implementations, emphasizing the ZDF approach.
* **Robust MIDI Handling**: Accurate timing and portamento processing for seamless pitch transitions.
* **Audiovisual Interaction**: Integrated with TouchDesigner to visually represent sound parameters in real-time.

## Hardware Requirements

* Bela platform (ARM-based embedded audio processor)
* MIDI controller (tested with Arturia MiniLab 3)
* Breadboard or custom control interface with potentiometers

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TR123e.git
```

2. Deploy the project onto your Bela board using the Bela IDE or terminal:

```bash
scp -r TR123e root@bela.local:/root/Bela/projects/
```

3. Connect your hardware interface and MIDI controller according to schematics provided in `schematics/`.

## Usage

* **Run TR-123e** from the Bela IDE.
* **Adjust parameters** using the hardware potentiometers for immediate sonic control.
* **Connect MIDI controllers** for extended expressive control and interaction.
