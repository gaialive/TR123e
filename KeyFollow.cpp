/**
 * @brief Generate frequency offset from MIDI note number
 * 
 * @param midiNote Input MIDI note number for tracking calculation
 * @return Frequency offset scaled by tracking intensity
 * 
 * @algorithm_analysis
 * The algorithm implements a three-stage transformation:
 * 
 * 1. **Reference Point Offset**: (midiNote - 36)
 *    - Note 36 (C2, ~65.4 Hz) serves as tracking reference
 *    - Notes below C2 are clamped to prevent negative offsets
 *    - Provides stable behavior across full MIDI note range
 * 
 * 2. **Frequency Scaling**: noteScaled * 0.33 + 36
 *    - 0.33 factor provides 1/3 proportional tracking
 *    - Addition of 36 restores absolute note reference
 *    - Results in musically appropriate tracking slope
 * 
 * 3. **Intensity Application**: result * keyFollowAmount
 *    - Scales final output by user-configurable intensity
 *    - Allows artistic control over tracking strength
 *    - Preserves linear relationship for predictable behavior
 * 
 * @mathematical_justification
 * The 0.33 scaling factor is derived from perceptual studies showing
 * that approximately 1/3 octave filter tracking per octave played
 * provides optimal timbre consistency across keyboard ranges in
 * subtractive synthesis applications.
 * 
 * @performance_characteristics
 * - Branch prediction friendly (single conditional)
 * - FPU pipeline efficient (sequential operations)
 * - Cache friendly (single memory access)
 * - Vectorization potential for SIMD implementations
