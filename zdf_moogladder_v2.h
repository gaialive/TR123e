 * @brief Zero-Delay Feedback Moog Ladder Filter Implementation
 * 
 * This module implements a sophisticated digital emulation of the iconic Moog transistor
 * ladder filter using Zero-Delay Feedback (ZDF) topology. The implementation provides
 * analog-accurate frequency response, self-oscillation behavior, and nonlinear saturation
 * characteristics while maintaining numerical stability across all parameter ranges.
 * 
 * @historical_significance
 * The Moog ladder filter, invented by Robert Moog in 1965, revolutionized electronic music
 * by providing the first practical voltage-controlled filter with musical resonance
 * characteristics. Its distinctive 24dB/octave roll-off and warm self-oscillation became
 * the defining sonic signature of analog synthesis, influencing virtually every subsequent
 * synthesizer design and establishing the paradigm for subtractive synthesis.
 * 
 * @circuit_theory_background
 * The original Moog ladder filter consists of four identical transconductance amplifier
 * stages connected in series, with a feedback path from the output to the input. Each
 * stage contributes 6dB/octave of attenuation, creating the characteristic 24dB/octave
 * low-pass response. The feedback path introduces resonance, and at high feedback levels,
 * the filter becomes unstable and self-oscillates, producing pure sinusoidal tones.
 * 
 * @zero_delay_feedback_theory
 * Traditional digital filter implementations suffer from the unit delay inherent in
 * recursive feedback structures, which creates frequency response errors and prevents
 * accurate analog modeling. Zero-Delay Feedback (ZDF) topology solves this by:
 * 
 * 1. **Implicit Integration**: Computing current output based on current input
 * 2. **Algebraic Loops**: Solving feedback equations simultaneously
 * 3. **Trapezoidal Integration**: Using Tustin transform for bilinear frequency mapping
 * 4. **State Variable Formulation**: Maintaining internal state for memory elements
 * 
 * @mathematical_foundation
 * The ZDF implementation uses the Trapezoidal Integrator (TPT) structure:
 * 
 * For each filter stage:
 * - v[n] = (u[n] - z[n]) / (1 + G)
 * - y[n] = v[n] + z[n]  
 * - z[n+1] = y[n] + v[n]
 * 
 * Where:
 * - G = tan(π × fc / fs) (frequency warping factor)
 * - v[n] = stage input after feedback subtraction
 * - y[n] = stage output
 * - z[n] = integrator state variable
 * - u[n] = input to current stage
 * 
 * @frequency_warping_compensation
 * The G parameter implements frequency pre-warping to compensate for bilinear transform
 * frequency compression. This ensures that the digital filter's cutoff frequency exactly
 * matches the analog prototype at the specified frequency, providing sample-rate
 * independent behavior and accurate frequency response.
 * 
 * @nonlinear_modeling
 * The implementation includes optional nonlinear feedback processing using hyperbolic
 * tangent (tanh) saturation to model the soft-clipping characteristics of the original
 * transistor circuitry. This nonlinearity contributes to the warm, musical character
 * of the Moog filter, particularly during self-oscillation.
 * 
 * @performance_characteristics
 * - Computational complexity: O(1) per sample (4 stages × constant operations)
 * - Memory footprint: 64 bytes (8 state variables × 8 bytes each)
 * - Numerical stability: Stable across all parameter ranges and sample rates
 * - Frequency accuracy: Exact cutoff frequency matching with pre-warping
 * - Dynamic range: Full 24-bit precision with proper gain staging

     * 
     * @numerical_stability_analysis
     * The ZDF formulation ensures stability by:
     * - Avoiding unit delays in feedback paths
     * - Using implicit integration for feedback loops
     * - Maintaining bounded state variables through proper coefficient calculation
     * - Preventing accumulation of numerical errors over time
     * 
     * @performance_optimization
     * - Stage processing uses identical operations for potential SIMD optimization
     * - Conditional nonlinear processing avoids unnecessary tanh calculations
     * - Mode selection uses switch statement for efficient branching
     * - All operations use single-precision floating-point for cache efficiency
     * 
     * @call_pattern
     * Must be called exactly once per audio sample for proper timing:
     * @code
     * for (int sample = 0; sample < bufferSize; ++sample) {
     *     float filtered = filter.process(inputBuffer[sample]);
     *     outputBuffer[sample] = filtered;
     * }
     * @endcode
     * 
     * @gain_staging_considerations
     * High resonance settings can increase output amplitude significantly.
     * Consider implementing output limiting or gain compensation for
     * consistent loudness across resonance settings in musical applications.
